# üåê RAG Web Browser

This Actor provides a web browsing functionality for AI and LLM applications,
similar to Web browser in ChatGPT. It queries Google Search for a specific phrase,
then crawls web pages from the top search results, cleans the HTML, and converts it to text or Markdown.
The resulting text can be injected to prompts and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) pipelines,
to provide your LLM application with up-to-date context from the web.

## Main features

- üöÄ **Quick response times** for great user experience
- ‚öôÔ∏è Supports **dynamic JavaScript-heavy websites** using a headless browser
- üï∑ Automatically **bypasses anti-scraping protections** using proxies and browser fingerprints
- üìù Output formats include **Markdown**, plain text, and HTML
- ü™ü It's **open source**, so you can review and modify it


## Usage

The RAG Web Browser can be used in two ways: **as a standard Actor** by passing it an input object with the settings,
or in the **Standby mode** by sending it an HTTP request.

### Normal Actor run

You can run the Actor "normally", pass it an input JSON object with settings including the search phrase via API or manually,
and it will store the results to the default dataset.
This is useful for testing and evaluation, but might be too slow for production applications and RAG pipelines,
because it takes some time to start a Docker container and the web browser.
Also, one Actor run can only handle one query, and thus it's inefficient.

### Standby web server

The Actor also supports the [**Standby mode**](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/running/standby),
where it runs an HTTP web server that receives requests with the search phrases and responds with the extracted web content.
This way is preferred for production application, because if the Actor is already running, it will
return the results much faster. Additionally, in this mode the Actor can handle multiple requests
in parallel, and thus utilizes the computing resources more efficiently.

To use RAG Web Browser in the Standby mode, simply send an HTTP GET request to the following URL:

```
https://rag-web-browser.apify.actor/search?token=APIFY_API_TOKEN&query=apify
```

The response is a JSON object containing the resulting web content from the top pages in search results.


#### Request

The `/search` GET HTTP endpoint accepts the following query parameters:

| `requestTimeoutSecs`             | `30`          | The maximum time allowed for the request, in seconds. If the request exceeds this time, it will be marked as failed.                                   |
| `proxyGroupSearch`               | `GOOGLE_SERP` | Select the proxy group for loading search results. Options: 'GOOGLE_SERP', 'SHADER'.                                                                   |

| `minConcurrency`                 |               | Minimum number of Playwright browsers running in parallel. Useful for defining a base level of parallelism.                                            |
| `maxConcurrency`                 |               | Maximum number of browsers or clients running in parallel to avoid overloading target websites.                                                        |

| `removeCookieWarnings`           |               | If enabled, removes cookie consent dialogs to improve text extraction accuracy. Note that this will impact latency.                                    |

#### ‚è≥ Performance and cost optimization


To optimize the performance and cost of your application,
see the [Standby mode settings](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/running/standby#how-do-i-customize-standby-configuration).


The latency is proportional to the **memory allocated** to the Actor and **number of results requested**.

Below is a typical latency breakdown for the RAG Web Browser with **initialConcurrency=3** and **maxResults** set to either 1 or 3.
These settings allow for processing all search results in parallel.

Please note the these results are only indicative and may vary based on the search term, the target websites,
and network latency.

The numbers below are based on the following search terms: "apify", "Donald Trump", "boston".
Results were averaged for the three queries.

| Memory (GB) | Max Results | Latency (s) |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 4           | 1           | 22          |
| 4           | 3           | 31          |
| 8           | 1           | 16          |
| 8           | 3           | 17          |

Based on your requirements, if low latency is a priority, consider running the Actor with 4GB or 8GB of memory.
However, if you're looking for a cost-effective solution, you can run the Actor with 2GB of memory, but you may experience higher latency and might need to set a longer timeout.

If you need to gather more results, you can increase the memory and adjust the `initialConcurrency` parameter accordingly.


## üé¢ How to optimize the RAG Web Browser for low latency?

For low latency, it's recommended to run the RAG Web Browser with 8 GB of memory. Additionally, adjust these settings to further optimize performance:

- **Initial Concurrency**: This controls the number of Playwright browsers running in parallel. If you only need a few results (e.g., 3, 5, or 10), set the initial concurrency to match this number to ensure content is processed simultaneously.
- **Dynamic Content Wait Secs**: Set this to 0 if you don't need to wait for dynamic content. This can significantly reduce latency.
- **Remove Cookie Warnings**: If the websites you're scraping don't have cookie warnings, set this to false to slightly improve latency.
- **Debug Mode**: Enable this to store debugging information if you need to measure the Actor's latency.

If you require a response within a certain timeframe, use the `requestTimeoutSecs` parameter to define the maximum duration the Actor should spend on making search requests and crawling.


## ‚úÉ How to set up request timeout?

You can set the `requestTimeoutSecs` parameter to define how long the Actor should spend on making the search request and crawling.
If the timeout is exceeded, the Actor will return whatever results were scraped up to that point.

For example, the following outputs (truncated for brevity) illustrate this behavior:
- The first result from http://github.com/apify was scraped fully.
- The second result from http://apify.com was partially scraped due to the timeout. As a result, only the `googleSearchResult` is returned, and in this case, the `googleSearchResult.description` was copied into the `text` field.

```json
[
  {
    "crawl": {
      "httpStatusCode": 200,
      "httpStatusMessage": "OK",
      "requestStatus": "handled"
    },
    "googleSearchResult": {
      "description": "Apify command-line interface helps you create, develop, build and run Apify actors, and manage the Apify cloud platform.",
      "title": "Apify",
      "url": "https://github.com/apify"
    },
    "text": "Apify ¬∑ Crawlee ‚Äî A web scraping and browser automation library for Python"
  },
  {
    "crawl": {
      "httpStatusCode": 500,
      "httpStatusMessage": "Timed out",
      "requestStatus": "failed"
    },
    "googleSearchResult": {
      "description": "Cloud platform for web scraping, browser automation, and data for AI.",
      "title": "Apify: Full-stack web scraping and data extraction platform",
      "url": "https://apify.com/"
    },
    "text": "Cloud platform for web scraping, browser automation, and data for AI."
  }
]
```

## üí° How to use RAG Web Browser in OpenAI Assistant as a tool for web search?

You can use the RAG Web Browser to provide up-to-date information from Google search results to your OpenAI Assistant.
The assistant can use the RAG Web Browser as a tool and whenever it needs to fetch information from the web, it sends request a request to the RAG Web Browser based on the search query.

For a complete example with images and detailed instructions, visit the [OpenAI Assistant integration](https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/openai-assistants#real-time-search-data-for-openai-assistant) page.

## ‚ìò Limitations and feedback

The Actor defaults to Google Search in the United States and English language
and so queries like "_best nearby restaurants_" will return search results from the US.

If you need other regions or languages, or have some other feedback, please submit an issue on the
Actor in Apify Console to let us know.

## üë∑üèº Development

The RAG Web Browser Actor has open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/apify/rag-web-browser),
