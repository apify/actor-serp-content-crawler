## RAG Web Browser

This Actor retrieves website content from the top Google Search Results Pages (SERPs).
Given a search query, it fetches the top Google search result URLs and then follows each URL to extract the text content from the targeted websites.

The RAG Web Browser is designed for Large Language Model (LLM) applications or LLM agents to provide up-to-date Google search knowledge.

**Main features**:
- Searches Google and extracts the top Organic results.
- Follows the top URLs to scrape HTML and extract website text, excluding navigation, ads, banners, etc.
- Capable of extracting content from JavaScript-enabled websites and bypassing anti-scraping protections.
- Output formats include plain text, markdown, and HTML.

This Actor is a combination of a two specialized actors:
- [Google Search Results Scraper](https://apify.com/apify/google-search-scraper)
- [Website Content Crawler](https://apify.com/apify/website-content-crawler)

### Fast responses using the Standby mode

This Actor can be run in both normal and [standby modes](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/running/standby).
Normal mode is useful for testing and running in ad-hoc settings, but it comes with some overhead due to the Actor's initial startup time.

For optimal performance, it is recommended to run the Actor in Standby mode.
This allows the Actor to stay active, enabling it to retrieve results with lower latency.

*Limitations*: Running the Actor in Standby mode does not support changing crawling and scraping configurations using query parameters.
Supporting this would require creating crawlers on the fly, which would add an overhead of 1-2 seconds.

#### How to start the Actor in a Standby mode?

You need the Actor's standby URL and `APIFY_API_TOKEN`. Then, you can send requests to the `/search` path along with your `query` and the number of results (`maxResults`) you want to retrieve.

```shell
curl -X GET https://jiri-spilka--rag-web-browser.apify.actor/search?token=APIFY_API_TOKEN?query=apify&maxResults=1
```

Hereâ€™s an example of the server response (truncated for brevity):
```json
[
  {
    "crawl": {
      "httpStatusCode": 200,
      "loadedAt": "2024-09-02T08:44:41.750Z",
      "uniqueKey": "3e8452bb-c703-44af-9590-bd5257902378",
      "requestStatus": "handled"
    },
    "metadata": {
      "author": null,
      "title": "Apify: Full-stack web scraping and data extraction platform",
      "description": "Cloud platform for web scraping, browser automation, and data for AI....",
      "keywords": "web scraper,web crawler,scraping,data extraction,API",
      "languageCode": "en",
      "url": "https://apify.com/"
    },
    "text": "Full-stack web scraping and data extraction platform..."
  }
]
```

The Standby mode has several configuration parameters, such as Max Requests per Run, Memory, and Idle Timeout.
You can find the details in the [Standby Mode documentation](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/running/standby#how-do-i-customize-standby-configuration).

## API parameters

When running in the standby mode the RAG Web Browser accept the following query parameters:

| parameter            | description                                                                                          |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `quety`              | Search term(s)                                                                                       |
| `maxResults`         | Number of top search results to return from Google. Only organic results are returned and counted    |
| `outputFormats`      | Specifies the output formats you want to return (e.g., "markdown", "html"); text is always returned  |
| `requestTimeoutSecs` | Timeout (in seconds) for making the search request and processing its response                       |


### What is the best way to run the RAG Web Browser?

The RAG Web Browser is designed to be run in Standby mode for optimal performance.
The Standby mode allows the Actor to stay active, enabling it to retrieve results with lower latency.
The latency is proportional to the memory allocated to the Actor and number of results requested.

Here is a typical latency breakdown for the RAG Web Browser.
Please note the these results are only indicative and may vary based on the search term and the target websites.

The numbers below are based on the following search terms: "apify", "Donald Trump", "boston". Results were averaged for the three queries.

| Memory (GB) | Max Results | Latency (s) |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 2           | 1           | 36          |
| 2           | 5           | 88          |
| 4           | 1           | 22          |
| 4           | 5           | 46          |

### Run STANDBY mode using apify-cli for development
```bash
APIFY_META_ORIGIN=STANDBY apify run -p
```

# Open question:

Response object - should we create an envelope object for the response?
```json
{
    "statusCode": 200,
    "message": "Finished",
    "results": [
        {
            "text": "Content",
